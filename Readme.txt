# Project: CNN - Image Classification

## üìù Overview
This project implements a complete end-to-end Deep Learning pipeline using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.  
The goal of this project is to develop a proof of concept for a structured end-to-end Deep Learning model.
It covers all stages ‚Äî from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, deployment and a CI/CD workflow prepared.

## üöÄ Project Pipeline
1. **Data Collection** ‚Äì CIFAR10 dataset that contains images with the following categories: 'plane', 'car', 'bird', 'cat','deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'
2. **Preprocessing** ‚Äì Flipping, Cropping, Shifting, Contrast Adjustment.
3. **Model Architecture** ‚Äì CNN built with PyTorch.
4. **Training** 
    ‚Äì Epochs: 50
    - Batch size: 256
    - Optimizer: Adam
    - Metric to evaluate: Accuracy 
    - Hardware: Nvidia RTX 4070 SUPER
5. **Deployment** 
    - Used the model via Flask API (+HTML and CSS)
    - Created a Docker File
    - Uploaded to EC2
6. **Workflow** - when app.py or CNN_architecture.py changes deployment is performed again.
